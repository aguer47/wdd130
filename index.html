            <p>Hello! My name is Majok, and am from South Sudan. I enjoy playing football and video games and I also
                make
                time for scripture study and occasional workouts. I am passionate about learning new things, connecting
                with
                people and always looking for ways to grow spiritually, mentally and physically. I value positivity,
                teamwork and perseverance.</p>
